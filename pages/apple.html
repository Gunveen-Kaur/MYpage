				<h2>RATINGS(★★★★★)	& REVIEWS<h2><br>
					<p>MacBook Air MQD32LL/A<em>	★★☆☆☆</em></p>
						<p class="review"><img src="../images/usericon.jpg" alt="usericon" height=30 width=30>The trim, light Asus ROG Zephyrus M (GU502GV) is a solid-enough gaming laptop all around, but for the price and performance as tested in our RTX 2060 config, it's not the top value we've seen.</p>
						<p class="review"><img src="../images/usericon.jpg" alt="usericon" height=30 width=30>The peppy, pricey Alienware m15 now offers a brilliant OLED screen, but the competition has upped its game since we last reviewed it. We'd recommend several other models right now—especially as Alienware has a redesign coming.Windows laptop in the world. What’s more, there’s a wide range of customization options, so you can really make the Dell XPS 13 the best laptop for your needs. The 2019 model doesn't bring a huge amount of improvements, but then not that much about the Dell XPS 13 needs improving. Its webcam has been placed at the top center of the screen, rather than at the bottom, which a lot of customers have been asking for.</p>
					<p>MacBook MRQN2C/A<em>		★★★☆☆</em></p>
						<p class="review"><img src="../images/usericon.jpg" alt="usericon" height=30 width=30>I did not like it much:-( <br>So i won't recommend</p>
						<p class="review"><img src="../images/usericon.jpg" alt="usericon" height=30 width=30>The Asus ROG Zephyrus S GX701 is the best gaming laptop of 2019 thanks to its powerful components that include a 6-core Intel processor, and the latest RTX 2080 graphics from Nvidia. It's also one of the best Asus laptops ever made. Not only is this a brilliant performer, but it's also impressively thin and light as well (by gaming laptop standards). Asus' Zephyrus laptops have constantly pushed the boundaries of what gaming laptops can do, and this new model for 2019 is no difference, which is why it has made it straight onto our best laptops list.</p>
						<p class="review"><img src="../images/usericon.jpg" alt="usericon" height=30 width=30>Thanks in part to its Intel Core i9 CPU option, the sleek 2019 reboot of the 15-inch Apple MacBook Pro we tested is one of the most powerful laptops you can buy for multimedia editing, data analysis, and other similar tasks. We'd just like to see some bolder design moves in the next model.Windows laptop in the world.

					<p>MacBook Air MGXC2LL/A<em>	★★★★☆</em></p>
						<p class="review"><img src="../images/usericon.jpg" alt="usericon" height=30 width=30>Apple has come out swinging with some seriously beefed up specs for the 13-inch MacBook Pro 2018, and even more so if you go for the larger 15-inch model. The headline Touch Bar – a thin OLED display at the top of the keyboard which can be used for any number of things, whether that be auto-suggesting words as you type or offering Touch ID so you can log in with just your fingerprint – is again included. It's certainly retained Apple's sense of style, but it comes at a cost. This is a pricey machine, so you may want to consider one of the Windows alternatives. If you're open to switching to a PC, definitely consider the XPS 13 or the excellent MateBook X Pro. But, if you're a steadfast Apple diehard, this is definitely the best laptop for you!</p>
						<p class="review"><img src="../images/usericon.jpg" alt="usericon" height=30 width=30>It's good for programmers!!!!</p>
						<p class="review"><img src="../images/usericon.jpg" alt="usericon" height=30 width=30>BEST MACHINE TILL DATE!!!<br>If you're after the latest and greatest laptop from Apple, we suggest you look into the 2018 model of the 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar. While Microsoft had the performance edge over last year's MacBook Pro, with the Surface Book 2, Apple has come out swinging with some seriously beefed up specs for the 13-inch MacBook Pro 2018, and even more so if you go for the larger 15-inch model. </p>
